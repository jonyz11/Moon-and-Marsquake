# Moon-and-Marsquake
All MATLAB codes used in the development of the paper 'Analysing a Moon and Marsquake Impact: A Study on the Resilience of Simple Structures Subjected to Seismic Activity on the Moon and Mars'.

The files MA1.txt and S01 - S14.txt are inputs into the two MATLAB script files. Only two events' time histories are provided, but others could be obtained from Earthscope Consortium's SAGE DMC web services.
